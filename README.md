# Auto_Sonnet

nonfunctional work in progress at the moment

eventually i planned to have the json dictionary map to a python dictionary of rhymes and a python dictionary of words with syllable lengths as the keys
after that, the logic for writing which words are able to precede which words will be simple. I'm not sure how i'll work out grammar... maybe I'll use an
external library for that, at least for the short term.
